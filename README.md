#Choice Experiment 

A Study on estimating the willingness-to-pay for improved green spaces in Edinburgh, Scotland's parks. 
Partipants were asked to choose between randomised combinations of  more Public facilities, wildflower meadows and/or benches in Parks, vs the additional cost they were willing to pay. 
Using a clogit model, the willingness to pay for each of these improved park attributes was estimated. Participants also filled in a survey to account for demographic variables. 
Accounting for Gender, found female participants were more willing-to-pay for green space and public facilities.
